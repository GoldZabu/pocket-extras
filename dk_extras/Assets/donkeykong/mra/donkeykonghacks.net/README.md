These are all the Donkey Kong hacks from <a href="http://www.donkeykonghacks.net">donkeykonghacks.net</a>. I think the Donkey Kong community regards these are some of the best DK hacks out there.

These MRA files will create ROM files that can be used with the FPGA Donkey Kong core for the Analogue Pocket. They probably work on Mister, too.

To make the ROMs using the MRA files takes a few extra steps compare with the usual way. Each one uses a modified `dkong.zip` using the IPS patches from  <a href="http://www.donkeykonghacks.net">donkeykonghacks.net</a>. These mras <b>DO NOT</b> use the standard dkong.zip from all over the place.

Please use the following steps to create the correct ROM file:

1. Download the ips files from http://www.donkeykonghacks.net
2. Patch a fresh copy of dkong.zip with the ips you downloaded (The site in step #1 may have a hint of where to get a working dkong.zip under links)
3. Rename the patched dkong.zip to whatever ips file you downloaded.
		For example, if you downloaded dkaaa.ips, rename the patched dkong.zip to dkaaa.zip
4. Convert to a .rom file in the usual way.
5. Repeat these steps for each .rom you want to make

If you're having trouble getting these working, try this <a href="/Assets/donkeykong/mra/donkeykonghacks.net/ips/README.md">method</a> instead. I have found this works more consistently.

All of these Donkey Kong hacks where brought to the Pocket thanks to <b><a href="https://github.com/GoldZabu">GoldZabu</a></b>. Thank you!
