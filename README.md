# Extra Files for the Analogue Pocket

Currently, this repository includes extra json files for the newly released CPS2 core by Jotego. Some MRA files create roms that don't have JSON files, so I have included them here.

In particular, there are JSON files for the Color Blind hacks for Super Puzzle Fighter. Originally, those MRA files created roms with identical names to the main rom. I changed the MRA files so they create a separate rom.

For example: For `Super Puzzle Fighter II X' Prime (Euro 2100823)`, the rom is named `spf2xe.rom`. Previously, for `Super Puzzle Fighter II X' Prime (Euro 2100823) [CB V.1]` it would use the same name. I changed it so it now makes this rom: `spf2xec1.rom`. The JSON files in the repo will look for this rom.

For every JSON files I have in the repo, I've also included the MRA file. And, each JSON has the corresponding Presets.
