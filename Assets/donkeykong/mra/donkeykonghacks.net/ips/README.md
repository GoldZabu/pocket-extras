These IPS files are intended to be used on a working `dkong.rom` file.
These IPS files are <b>NOT</b> intended to be used on a dkong.zip.

Make sense? :)

If you aren't able to use the MRA files successfully from the previous folder, give these a try.

1. Create the dkong.rom from the standard Donkey Kong MRA.
2. Use these patches on the dkong.rom file to create the ROM file for each hack.
3. Make sure the patched ROM has the same name as the patch.

I have found that these IPS files consistently work better than the MRA files.

Again, all of these Donkey Kong hacks where brought to the Pocket thanks to <b><a href="https://github.com/GoldZabu">GoldZabu</a></b>. Thank you!
